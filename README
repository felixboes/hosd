*) Some introductory words

Our program is used to compute the homology of unlabelled 1-Sullivan diagrams.


*) Performing computations

In order to perform computations, you need to perform several steps.

1) You need to create the top cells for h=2g+m.
This is done with
  ./create_and_store_top_cells.py --hh h
in the unparametrized case and with
  ./create_and_store_top_cells.py -p --hh h
in the parametrized case.

2) Then, you need to construct the integral chain complex and save it to a certain file (here it is called test.chomp):
  ./compute_homology.py -g genus -m punct --save_homchain test.chomp
where 'genus' the genus you are interested in and 'punct' the number of punctures you are interested in.

There are more options that can be feeded to the progam e.g.:
  -p
for the parametrized unenmerated case
  -v
for more status messages
  -s
for almost no status messages
  --only_good_stuff
computes the homology of all cells having no internal punctures or genus.

The output of our program will be written to the 'standard output' and to a file in the folder 'results'.

3) You need to compute the homology of the chain complex:
In case you do not have homchain installed, hit
  make
Then you can compute the homology (of the file test.chomp) hit
  ./homchain_gmp test.chomp


*) Program version

The version of the program is either provided by the file 'data/version' or it is the git-version of the program.
