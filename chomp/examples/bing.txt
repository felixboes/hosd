Bing's house with two rooms is an example of a contractible cubical set,
built of squares embedded in R^3, which cannot be reduced by means of
free face collapses.

The two versions contained in this package were prepared by Jaroslaw Karpiak.
The computations are performed by the program "homcubes".
