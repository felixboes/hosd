This is a real example of a map which seems to be good for homology
computation, but the program "homcubes" reduces the cubes in such a way
that after the reduction the map is no longer acyclic. However, if one
turns on the careful reduction method which does preserve the acyclicity
of the map (this is done by the "-a" switch), then the program works fine
(though slower) and gives the right result.
This example was provided by Sarah Day and comes from the Conley index
for the Henon map.

Note: The above holds true for "homcubes" version 3.07 as of August 2010,
but may not apply to the new revisions of "homcubes" due to the possible
changes in the reduction algorithms.
