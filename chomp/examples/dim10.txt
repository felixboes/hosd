*** dim10 ***

In this example the homology of a 10-dimensional hypercube in R^10
is computed.

The definition of the cube is stored in the file "dim10.cub".
The computations are performed by the program "homcubes".

This example illustrates the major difficulty in handling high-dimensional
data: The huge numer of faces of each single hypercube.
