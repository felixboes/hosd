*** slicing ***

This is an example of a big cube with some small cubes removed from it 
in such a way that the resulting set is homotopically equivalent to the 
wadge sum of 2 circles, 2 spheres and one torus of genus 2. This example 
was created with a program by T. Grudskaya, which I got from G. Watson.

If this set is sliced along one of the coordinate axes into several pieces 
which overlap for the width of one or more cubes, then these pieces 
can be reduced separately, provided the overlapping parts are preserved. 
After gluing the reduced pieces together, one can compute the homology of 
this set and the result should be the same as for the entire set, but the 
computations should be faster.
