*** wrapped ***

This example illustrates the idea of space wrapping. If we take a set 
of squares in the plane depicted in the picture below (each '#' indicates 
a squre; spaces between the squares were added to make the picture clear). 
It can be easily seen that this figure has 3 connected components and its 
homology over Z is: H_0 = Z^3, H_1 = 0. However, if we "wrap" the space 
every 10 squares, then some loops appear and it turns out that the entire 
figure becomes connected.
