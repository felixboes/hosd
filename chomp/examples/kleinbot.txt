In this example, the homology module of the Klein bottle
is computed with coefficients in Z and in Z_2.

The homology module is computed by the program "homcubes". We first 
compute the homology module with integer coefficients, and then with 
coefficients in Z_2.

This example contains two representations of the Klein bottle.
One consists of 4-dimensional full cubes in R^4 and was created
with the use of a parametrization for embedding of this manifold
into R^4. The other one consists of 2-dimensional elementary cubes
(cubical cells) in R^4 and was obtained from the first one
by geometric reduction programmed in "homcubes".
