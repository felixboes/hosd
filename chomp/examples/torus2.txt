*** torus 2 ***

In this example the homomorphism induced in homology by a combinatorial
cubical multivalued map on a torus is computed.

A representation of the torus built of full cubes in R^3 is used,
and each cube is mapped to a set of cubes in this representation.
The image of the map is wound twice along the torus, which is reflected
in the homomorphism induced in homology.

An interesting additional feature of this map is that careful reduction
algorithm must be used (activated by the "-a" switch to "homcubes"),
or otherwise the result of the computations is wrong.

The additional switch "-i" makes the program additionally compute
the homomorphism induced in homology by the inclusion of the domain
into the codomain of the map, so that the final map is printed
with respect to the same homology generators.

This example was provided by Prof. Marian Mrozek.
