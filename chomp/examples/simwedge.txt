*** simwedge ***

In this example, the homology of a simplicial complex of the wedge of the
sphere and two circles is computed. Note that the homology of this object,
which in this example consists of the boundary of a tetrahedron joined
with boundaries of two adjacent triangles, is the same as the homology
of the torus, and thus these two objects cannot be distinguished
from each other just by homology computation.

In the first step, a chain complex is created from the list of simplices 
of the highest dimension by the program "simchain". Then the homology of 
this chain complex is computed by the program "homchain".

The program "homsimpl" can perform both steps of the computations at one fell
swoop. It is used to compute the homology of the simplicial complex directly.
