This is a series of examples of simplicial complexes represented in terms
of faces of an n-dimensional hypercube in R^n.

These examples illustrate the theorem saying that every simplicial complex
can be realized by means of a (general) cubical set contained in the boundary
of a single n-dimensional cube in R^n.

This theorem in particular proves that the intersection of a full cube
with its neighboring full cubes can be arbitrarily complicated.

These examples were prepared by Anik Trahan from University of Sherbrooke.
