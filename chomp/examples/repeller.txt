This example illustrates how to compute the discrete Conley index of a 
repelling fixed point in R^1.

First, the Szymczak's algorithm for finding an isolating neighborhood 
and an index pair is used. Then the program "homcubes" is used to compute 
the discrete Conley index which consists of the relative homology of the 
index pair and the map induced in homology by f and by the inclusion.
