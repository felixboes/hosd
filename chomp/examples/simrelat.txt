In this example, the relative homology of a pair of simplicial complexes 
is computed. Both complexes represent circles, but relative homology of 
the pair is not trivial.

In the first step, a chain complex is created from the list of simplices 
of the highest dimension in each element of the pair by the program 
"simchain". Then the homology of this chain complex is computed by the 
program "homchain".

The program "homsimpl" can perform both steps of the computations at one
fell swoop. It is used to compute the homology of the pair of simplicial
complexes directly.
