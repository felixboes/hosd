In this example, the homology of a simplicial complex of the projective 
plane is computed.

In the first step, a chain complex is created from the list of simplices 
of the highest dimension by the program "simchain". Then the homology of 
this chain complex is computed by the program "homchain", first with 
coefficients in Z, then in Z_2.

The program "homsimpl" can perform both steps of the computations at one
fell swoop. It is used to compute the homology of the simplicial complex
directly over the field Z_13.

Note that in all the three cases you should obtain different results.
