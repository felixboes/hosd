*** numeric cubes ***

This example illustrates a compact representation of cubical sets and maps.

Since the same cubes are often repeated several times in the definition
of a map, the homology software accepts using plain integer numbers
starting at 1 to reprsent cubes in the input data files. In order to
associate the numbers with appropriate cubes, one must prepare the set
of all the cubes used in the data files and list them in a separate file,
whose name is passed to the homology software with the '-c' argument.

Please, consult the specific data files for more details.
