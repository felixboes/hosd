In this example the homology module over Z and over Z_2 of the projective 
plane is computed.

A chain complex of the projective plane is stored in a file and its 
homology module is computed by the program "homchain". The computations 
are performed first with the coefficients in Z, and then in Z_2.

Note: A simplicial complex of the projective plane embedded into the
boundary of a 5-dimensional hypercube as a cubical set was prepared
by Navin Sivakumar. Please, see the accompanying PDF file for details.
