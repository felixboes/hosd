This example shows a Conley index map which seems fine
for the homology computathion, but the homomorphism
induced in homology by the inclusion of the index pair
into its enlargement by its image is not an isomorphism.
A way to overcome this problem is to lift the cubes
in X\A to a higher level, either by modifying the input data,
or by using the program "homcub2l".
