*** thin circle ***

In this example a map of a circle onto itself with double winding 
is defined. The map in homology thus maps the 1-dimensional generator 
onto itself with the multiplication coefficient 2. The map is given
as a multivalued map defined on cubical cells of dimension lower
than the space dimension, and thus cannot be handled by the program
"homcubes" directly.

This is a modification of the "circle" example. This example uses
a demonstration program "homcelmp", so make sure that the "progdemo"
set of programs has also been compiled.
